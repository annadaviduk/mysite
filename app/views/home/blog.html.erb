	 <br><h1>Buy or not to buy links</h1></br>

		<p>A bit of history.</p>

		<br><p>Do we need to buy links? Is it safe?
		Before answering this question we must go back to basics. Why do I need references? Can we not have a website these links with a high rating?</p></br>
		<p>Here's how Google ranks the web pages:</p>

		<br><p>Google is building according to the value of the ratings sites. Determining this value - is Page Rank. Google considers and evaluates the quality of links to web sites hosted on other sites. In other words, the link from site A to site B is considered the "voice", and if the site B are linked to 300 sites, it is considered more important than the one to which are only 5 or 10 links (this is the case if the quality of the links about the same.) Thus, the more links leading to your website, it is considered that content of this site is interesting and useful. In the last 3-4 years, many site owners do link exchange - if you place on your site my banner, I'll post yours.</p></br>
		<p>In my opinion, it is. And if you look at it from this point of view, buying links in our time should be standard practice.</p>

		<br><p>You just have to be careful in this kind of promotion if your site is quite young and don't have much popularity. Google uses a lot of ways to identify sites that use this type of promotion. In worse case you site can be pushed down in search or even banned.</p></br>
